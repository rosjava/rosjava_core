rosjava_core
============

rosjava is a pure Java implementation of ROS. It provides a client library that
enables Java programmers to quickly interface with ROS Topics, Services, and
Parameters. It also provides a Java implementation of `roscore`_. Using rosjava
is ideal when you need to:

- interact with prior Java programs or libraries
- write Android apps that work with ROS

Please see the :doc:`overview` page for documentation on how to use rosjava in your
projects.

Support is best found on http://answers.ros.org/.

Please file bugs and feature requests on the rosjava `issues`_ page. Starring
issues that are important to you will help developers prioritize their work.

In addition to the following documentation, rosjava makes liberal use of
`Javadoc`_.
