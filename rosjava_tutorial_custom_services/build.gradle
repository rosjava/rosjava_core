 Examples of
   1) dependencies from another project in this gradle stack.
   2,3) open ranged dependencies from a maven repository.

   Dependencies can be on external maven artifacts (such as rosjava_core
   here) or on sibling subprojects. For rosjava maven artifact dependencies
   it is a good idea to use open ranges on to
   save continually updating these references, but it is recommended
   to restrict this to the patch version number (e.g. [0.3,0.4) will
   get the latest 0.3.x version) to avoid unknowingly
   having api breaking changes usually associated with minor and major
   version number changes.
