<section name="The Logging Component">

<p>When writing a library it is very useful to log information. However there
are many logging implementations out there, and a library cannot impose the use
of a particular one on the overall application that the library is a part of.</p>

<p>The Logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different logging
implementations.  A library that uses the commons-logging API can be used with
any logging implementation at runtime. Commons-logging comes with support for a
number of popular logging implementations, and writing adapters for others is a
reasonably simple task.</p>

<p>Applications (rather than libraries) may also choose to use commons-logging.
While logging-implementation independence is not as important for applications
as it is for libraries, using commons-logging does allow the application to
change to a different logging implementation without recompiling code. 
</p><p>
Note that commons-logging does not attempt to initialise or terminate the underlying
logging implementation that is used at runtime; that is the responsibility of
the application. However many popular logging implementations do automatically
initialise themselves; in this case an application may be able to avoid
containing any code that is specific to the logging implementation used.</p>

    <subsection name='1.1.1 Release - November 2007'>
      <p>
       This release is a minor update to the 1.1 release that fixes a number of bugs, and 
       resolves packaging issues for maven 1.x and maven 2.x users.
      </p>
      <p>For the full details, see the release notes for this version.</p> 
    </subsection>
    <subsection name='1.1 Release - 10 May 2006'>
      <p>This release makes several changes that are intended to resolve issues that
      have been encountered when using commons-logging in servlet containers or j2ee
      containers where complex classpaths are present and multiple copies of
      commons-logging libraries are present at different levels.</p>
      <p>This release also adds support for the TRACE level added to log4j in the
      1.2.12 release. In former commons-logging versions, the log.trace method
      caused log4j to output the message at the DEBUG level (the lowest level
      supported by log4j at that time).</p>
      <p>For the full details, see the release notes for this version.</p> 
    </subsection>
    <subsection name='1.0.5 Release (Alpha)'>
      <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> the 1.0.5 release was abandoned at alpha status.
      </p>
      <p>
    The next JCL release will be designated 1.1 since we feel this more 
    accurately reflects the improvements made to the codebase.</p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection name='1.0.4 Release - 16 Jun 2004'>
      <p>
The 1.0.4 release of commons-logging is a service
release containing support for both the 1.2.x and 1.3.x series of Log4J releases. 
      </p>
    </subsection>

    </subsection>
